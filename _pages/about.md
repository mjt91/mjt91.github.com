      <p>Hi! I'm Marius.</p>
      <p>My background is Mathematics & Economics and started my career in Finance.
      My current focus lies in Time Series Forecasting, which I think is - in the times of big neural nets - a dying field!</p>
      <p>I write code since my early study days, where I started with Pascal, C++, Matlab, R and Python. I stuck with the last two, even though I almost default to Python entirely nowadays.</p>
      <p>My three most loved hobbies are asian cusine, weight lifting and gaming.</p>
