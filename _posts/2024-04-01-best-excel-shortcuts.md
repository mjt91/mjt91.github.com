excerpt: An post for those obsessed to work with the keyboard and boost their productivity

I am a big believer that using the keyboard is always faster than using the mouse when it comes to get work done in Excel.
Funnily enough there are a [ton][excel-meme-1] [of memes][excel-meme-2] [about it][excel-meme-3].
This is only one of them:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“he uses excel without a mouse.” <a href="https://t.co/Gv8PG97Gk4">pic.twitter.com/Gv8PG97Gk4</a></p>&mdash; memes.xlsx (@ExcelHumor) <a href="https://twitter.com/ExcelHumor/status/1563714420148142080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Shoutout to [memes.xlsx][memes-xlsx-twitter] definitely worth a follow.

## Motivation
Recently we had some intern trying and he was (not) lucky to had the opportunity to checkout what my day-to-day work in Finance looks like.
I was showing him some presentations, some documents I prepared and some tools I use and build.
When I shared some excel file with him and moved around, created a table here and there, quick calculation he was surely impressed.

He even complimented me, saying that he had done some internships in Consulting and big Accounting firms but never seen someone beeing this proficient in navigation excel only using the keyboard.

Even if this sounds very nerdy now, this was joy to hear!
The intern was quite tech-savy, this could have do something with it though!

Anyways, we discussed, that many people in finance are from the business side and prefer to use the mouse.
When I interview colleagues, I often hear, that they use shortscuts for copy paste, but often not more.
They name that it is hard to remember them (and looking them up online first is not efficient, then just using the mouse *is* faster).

Today I drove around with my bike and was thinking why not collect all the shortcuts I find particularly important to know in Finance from my point of view.
I chose to group them by these categories

- General
- Navigation
- Formatting
