I am a passionate eater. I love it salty.
I love the good stuff, the fatty stuff (think: McDonalds, ...).
And yes, I know it is bad for me. Come on, judge me. I can take it. It is okay.

But, I am currently on the [Slow Carb diet][slow-carb}, which works great for me.
I like that it is simple to follow, with well-adjusted rules and the idea to allow for cheat days.
And oh lord is this a rabbit hole to jump into. I had no idea.
There are stories of some epic cheat days out there. **TODO add source.**

Once I discovered this, I thought "thank you for the inspiration!".
When I feel a craving in the middle to end of the work week, seeing cheat day is coming near I always write down the thing I have a craving for in a little note on my phone.
And when Saturday arrives I am as happy as a young boy on Christmas.

## Slow Carb Rundown


## Breakfast
My mornings are very plain (read: simple) under the Slow Carb diet: 3 eggs, spinach, some beans or lentils.
When I am not following the Slow Carb diet I am skipping breakfast.

Those are the cases which are not intersting for the sake of this post. Let's see what makes a great breakfast on cheat days.

It must be sweet (hot) or bread (which is savory/sweet mixxed).
