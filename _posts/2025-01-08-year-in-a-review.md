# Reviewing my 2024 Goals

‚úÖ **Work:** I did advance my career and got promoted to a senior position at my current employer right on time for 1st January 2025.  I moved more into the Data Science direction with my work and focused on model tuning and improving forecasting systems. I refactored a huge application updating the underlying python version and replacing important dependencies that were outdated. It was a tedious task, but improved the speed a lot and allows for more customization now.


üü†**Health & Sports:** I started lifting heavy more, but did not come near my goal to Squat 1.5x my body weight (~115 kg). That being said, I am overall I am happy: I increased my lung function by TODO and found a new way of cardio and endurance training: swimming! I always hated swimming, was very slow and out of breath easily. I started in late 2024 after reading the section about total immersion swimming in Tim Ferris' 4Hour Body book. This was one of the best things I learned this year and I can not recommend to try it enough (especially for people who do not like swimming!).

My current routine looks like this:
- roughly 7k steps per day
- Sleep ~6-7 hours
- heavy lifting 2x per week via 5x5 programme
- TI swim 1x per week
- Some other form of exercise (boulder, badminton, ...) occasionally on the weekends

## Personal Growth Goals

‚ùå‚ôüÔ∏è**Chess:** I wanted to reach 1300 in rapid time format on [chess.com](chess.com), but failed to do so. It is not that I was stuck, moreover I did not find time (or courage?) to play more.

In the end I am only 81 rating points short of my goal. On the good side all my ratings increased, I even reached 1100 in blitz (+118 ppts).
Also: I went to my local chess club. Only once due to time and work constraints, but it was a fun experience nevertheless. Maybe I will try to make it a re-occuring thing in 2025?


‚ùåüìñ **Reading:** I wanted to read more, also non-fiction. I only finished one book (but this was a big one): Atomic Habits. Great read and a great source of knowledge and guide for self improvement. I took many lessons from it. I started reading The Witcher series a couple 100 pages. It is nice, but it reads a bit harder than I would hoped (I love the story from having played the video games). Non fiction books will be on my reading list for 2025 again, as I feel it is a good thing to have a mix between fiction and non-fiction reading input.

‚úÖ**Wealth:** I did increase my wealth by [redacted]. Quite happy with my finances. My wife and I bought our first flat and financing plans look quite solid. Increased my monthly savings rate and put even more money down on the classic world ETF A1JX52.

## Things I learned
I often said that curiosity and willing to learn is a staple in my life defining who I am. I always try to find new things to dig deep into.

## Health: From Glory to Hell and Back
I needed to undergo some treatment mid 2024, which required me to stop taking important medication. This resulted in a severe downfall of my overall fitness level in the magnitude of  of (subjective) estimated -80%. Difference is running 3 kilometer in 08:30 min per kilometer and not managing to get up more than 1 floor without boosting up my heart rate above 120 bpm. It was **bad.** 

The worst of it all: turns out I had not to stop taking this important medicine at all! After consulting another doctor he told me, there is no evidence that this should've been necessary. I was outraged. I wrote a sonnet at the time expressing how I felt at the time: [Ein Sturm in der Brust]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2024/04/19/sonett-breath.html)

I am by no means a friend of pessimism. I went back onto the meds, got back into my fitness routine and fought back. The second half of the year went better for me. I have no troubles with increasing darkness and more rainy days than other people have (see Winterdepression), this helped a lot. I started to drink a cold glass of water in the morning to kickstart my metabolism. I still do this. It wakes me up way better.

I still cannot believe how this turned out in the end. My heart rate has stabilized again, I am stronger than ever and learned to swim properly.

- TODO add health graph about heart rate

From a health perspective 2024 can be summarized as "I went through hell and climbed back up!üöÄ"

## Projects

**My personal blog and writing:**
I switched my personal blogs template over to simple and self-maintained jekyll template. I learned a lot how to make changes to css, host it easily on github pages. For 2024, I also planned to write more articles on my personal blog. I wrote a few pieces I think turned out quite well/I am happy with:
- [I made a wishlist (and so should you) | mjt91](https://mjt91.github.io/blog/2024/06/28/wishlist.html)
- [How I set up my Phone for Productivity | mjt91](https://mjt91.github.io/blog/2024/07/31/how-i-set-up-my-phone.html)
- [Transforming my Master Thesis into an AI Podcast | mjt91](https://mjt91.github.io/blog/2024/09/30/notebook-lm-master-thesis.html)

In other news I received some feedback to bring back my ["Best of Boulevard"](https://mjt91.github.io/bob/) series, where I blog about the 3 funniest stories in German boulevard. I revived that and been posting updates there since September 2024 and plan to keep going at it.

I also wrote about [my goals for 2024](https://mjt91.github.io/blog/2024/09/17/goals-2024.html) (which I posted quite late, but had the goals defined in January already, as it is a yearly habit I follow). This year I plan to again write this but a bit sooner (hopefully üòÇ). 

**Other projects:**
I did not deliver on projects too much. Quite a bummer was that my [PUFO Twitter Bot](https://github.com/mjt91/pufo-twitter-bot) broke down because [buchtitel-generator.de](buchtitel-generator.de) went down in August 2024. I always thought to just generate the book titles using some generative AI model (e.g. grok or chatgpt) but never found the motivation to do it. Maybe 2025?

I tested different frameworks to build simple (web-)applications: [mjt91/framework-testing](https://github.com/mjt91/framework-testing)
I started building my own [zettelkasten](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) (which I maintain mainly at work). Public notes are pushed occasionally to [mjt91/zettelkasten](https://github.com/mjt91/zettelkasten).

I love using $\LaTeX$. But after my days in academia there is no real use anymore, but I come back from time to time. In April 2024 I created a ref-card with my most used excel shortcuts. The blog post is [mjt91/excel-shortcuts-cheatsheet](https://github.com/mjt91/excel-shortcuts-cheatsheet) and the cheat sheet is available on my GH [mjt91/excel-shortcuts-cheatsheet](https://github.com/mjt91/excel-shortcuts-cheatsheet).

## Mission Statement
I wrote about my mission statement first [here](https://mjt91.github.io/blog/2024/09/20/mission-statement.html). I think it is a good plan to revise this together with my review of my goals. So here is an updated version:

- I cherish my wife, family and nearest friends
- I try to find fun in everything I do
- I am not religious, but if someone asked me who my God is, I would answer:¬†_chance_
- I follow the teachings of Stoicism
- I think analytically
- I am a¬†_life-long learner_¬†/ I am curious
- I form opinions based on facts
- For me, things are not just black or white
- The thought of people remembering me as¬†**incompetent**¬†is horrifying
- Physical and mental fitness are very important to me
- I generally look positively towards the future
- I am not easily impressed
- The list of those who truly inspire me is very short
- I am an early riser
- I am honest and direct
- One of my mottos is¬†_‚ÄúHate the game - not the player‚Äù_
- I don‚Äôt believe in¬†_free lunch_
- I go through life with the attitude that if you truly want something, you must be honest with yourself, unafraid to pursue it, and have fun along the way
- Hard work is important to me (_‚ÄúPut in the hard work!‚Äù_)
- I am very competitive
- My thought process is driven by¬†_‚Äúframework thinking‚Äù_
