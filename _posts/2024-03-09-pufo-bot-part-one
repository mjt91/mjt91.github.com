I am a big fan of the [Podcast UFO Podcast][pufo-podcast].
In this german podcast [Florentin Will][florentin] and [Stefan Tieze][stefan] talk about mostly about comedy, impro and their everyday life.
What makes it really entertaining is that it is completly free of economics or politcs, which I find rare nowadays.
Sureley, there are podcasts about Harry Potter, true crime, etc. that do not cover any geopolitical events.
But most podcasts of that sort - i.e. just talking - default to making some political statements or talking about how bad the world has become.
It is refreshening so see, that there are podcasters out there that prefer to really enterain their audience.
I feel like they are really like that.

## The idea

I [episode PLACEHOLDER][episode] Florentin tells that he want in a deep rabbit hole of randomness.
He spent his Saturday evening creating random names on some website and went on creating random book titles from another website.

It turned out in a beautiful impro sketch where Florentin and Stefan played out a episode of ["Das literarische Quartett"][quartett-wiki]. There are many, many videos of it up on [YouTube][quartett-ty].
For anyone interested in literature this is a great ressource (and speaking german of course üòÅ).

**EXAMPLES OF TITLES NAMED BY FLORENTIN HERE**

At the end of the episode Florentin posed the idea: How great would it be, if there exists a bot that creates top litertature lists with randomly created book titles and authors?

Then it struck me: Why not build it?

## The books
Getting hold of randomly created book titles is not to hard to come by.
A quick google search gave me the perfect result: [buchtitelgenerator.de][buchtitel-generator].
Exactly what I was looking for.

As the time of writing this I am getting this result:

1. Eine britische Kehle mit Sorge
2. Stock ohne Sonne
3. Desillusionierte Geburten in der Mitte
4. Der M√ºller der Adjutanten
5. Farbenfrohe Nixen der Stelle

Interestingly the site even tells you the *algorithm* it uses to create the titels.
It says above the list

>Aus 1194 Substantiven und 1011 Adjektiven werden jeweils f√ºnf Buchtitel zuf√§llig erzeugt.

Which translates to *"Creating 5 random book titles using 1194 substantives and 1011 adjectives."*

My idea was simple: Build a webscraper and call the site and scrape the table with titles.

**But:** I am a fair player. Can I simply use the titles? What about copywrite?
I contacted the owner and asked politely if his site offers a public REST API endpoint and if I can use the generated titles for a side project.

I did not think he would answer. Maybe, I thought, the idea might die in an early stage.

But no! Surprisingly: Got I an answer! And a positive one indeed.

English tl;dr: No REST API yet (nice idea though). Feel free to use the titles if you give credit.
