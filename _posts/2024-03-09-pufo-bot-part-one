I am a big fan of the [Podcast UFO Podcast][pufo-podcast].
In this german podcast [Florentin Will][florentin] and [Stefan Tieze][stefan] talk about mostly about comedy, impro and their everyday life.
What makes it really entertaining is that it is completly free of economics or politcs, which I find rare nowadays.
Sureley, there are podcasts about Harry Potter, true crime, etc. that do not cover any geopolitical events.
But most podcasts of that sort - i.e. just talking - default to making some political statements or talking about how bad the world has become.
It is refreshening so see, that there are podcasters out there that prefer to really enterain their audience.
I feel like they are really like that.

## The idea

I [episode PLACEHOLDER][episode] Florentin tells that he want in a deep rabbit hole of randomness.
He spent his Saturday evening creating random names on some website and went on creating random book titles from another website.
