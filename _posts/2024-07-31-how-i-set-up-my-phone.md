# Origin

I wrote [here][wishlist] how I switched to an iPhone and that from then on it was my default phone. And the iPhone is great. It  provides all the utility I value in a smart phone.

But it comes at a cost: Apps try to seduce you to spend many many many hours on them (and worst case spend money for in-game shops or some other bullshit).

I must say I am pretty strong when it comes to this. I do not react instantly when I get a push notification. I do not need to check my mails or WhatsApp chats all the time. I am not angry when someone does not answer my messages in the next minute. I do not waste my time on social media at all (I read X and watch YouTube though).

Not everyone is like that. Many people have fallen into the endless feedback loop social media and smart phone apps. Data for Germany shows that the average screen time is almost around[ five and a half hours](https://www.comparitech.com/tv-streaming/screen-time-statistics/). I do not reach that number: At the time of writing this last week I averaged 2h 22m of screen time activity:
