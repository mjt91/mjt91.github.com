# Why
I recently wrote down [my goals for 2024]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-09-17-goals-2024 %}).
I plan to update my [personal mission statement][wiki-mission-statement] when I do my yearly review.

When I did this exercise I tried to answer very personal questions about my self (why do I am who I am? What drives me? What do I want to achieve? What is important to me?).
I highly recommend to do this yourself.

# Mission Statement

- I cherish my wife and family
- I try to find fun in everyhing I do
- I am not religious
- If someone asked me who my God is, I would answer: *chance*

- I form opinions based on facts
- For me, things are not just black or white
- The thought of people remembering me as **incompetent** is horrifying
- Physical and mental fitness are very important to me
- I generally look positively towards the future
- I see myself more as a pragmatist than an idealist
- I am not easily impressed

- The list of those who truly inspire me is very short
- I am an early riser
- I am honest and direct
- One of my mottos is *"Hate the game - not the player"*
- I don't believe in a *free lunch*
- I go through life with the attitude that if you truly want something, you must be honest with yourself, unafraid to pursue it, and have fun along the way
- Hard work is important to me (*"Put in the hard work!"*)
- My thought process is driven by *"framework thinking"*
